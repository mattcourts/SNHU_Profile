# The Gaming Room


**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room is the client seeking to expand their mobile game to other platforms.  The design document specifies the recommended development plan to expand the app for multiple platforms.  

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

The design document provides reasoning behind design choices, expanding to the benefits of the paths taken.  Covering specific hardwarware needs and options, with future infrastructure scaling.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Having access to UML documentation on the structure of the application allows for planning fo future changes and integration into a client-server system.  This allowed determining the needs of the app.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

For improvement I would revise the recommendations based on the methods chosen by The Game Room for hosting the game server.  Every method describe has its benefits and needs change.  Self hosting may have the most requirements wereas hosting on Amazon or Google some features may already be built in if utilized.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Every company has different needs, understanding those needs is necessary for both parties to succeed.  The Gaming Room and has well designed program that need to be improved to handle a client-server setup.  Assessing the current system and stakeholders allows for finding the apporpriate amount of change needed.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I have worked in the software industry assessing customer needs for implementing software, training, and support for ERP, CAD/CAM systems.  Listening and understanding what the customers goals allows you to see through their eyes.  Taking that bit alone allows for success.  For the Design template taking the along the dev tools comparison will allow better decisions for tools and architecture choices.
