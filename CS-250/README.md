Interpreting customer needs relies on analyzing the needs of the request and how it impacts the software and the customer. This allows you to define what needs to occur and how it should operate for the customer. This information in terms of agile will be turned into a user story for the team to use for development. User Stories are a core aspect of how agile teams operate. The story created by the end-user or stakeholders describes an action or feature that would benefit the end user/stakeholder. This story comes with a detailed description of why this feature would be of benefit. More importantly, every story has the acceptance criteria, the end goal of the story. 

Developing programs can be done by using various strategies, agile being the newest and more common approach. This will allow you to guide development through user needs and team structure to complete the tasks in cycles. Scrum is a more common agile framework that can be scaled to the size of the corporation. This can be used even on a personal level, setting goals and development cycles allowing for focus on development in areas of the software especially for getting started. This will scale as more members are added to the team and roles grow. 

Being a part of a team requires understanding your role and impact on the team. Good team work occurs when teams work together for a common goal. Agile requires teams that work really well together as it is a highly collaborative framework. Collaboration can occur with external teams as well.
