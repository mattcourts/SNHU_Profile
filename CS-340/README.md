How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- Good programs are written by understanding the need the needs of the program and what problem its purpose is to resolve.  Designing an outline of the program of the areas that need developement allow for planning along with agile style development being applies.  This will allows the program to be developed in phases, adding new features with each cycle and applying bug fixes.  Each CRUD feature was applied one at a time while building upon the previous feature.  The mongo connector was improved and further built on with each development cycle.  Taking the CRUD app further I would update it for returning the data into a local class of the data structure.  This can be applied to MVC style application with a template framwork, Django python web framework if notable for using this.  The database and object structure match allowing the Views to be focused around the modelling of the data. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a software developer I have a similar approach as a computer sciend to a problem, the most important aspect is to understand the problem and the solution.  having a clear goal allows for a path of development to be planned out.  Requirments can be defined and tasked out allowing for prioritization of new features.  This can be applied in a cyclical or rapid development environment.  With database design, understanding the data that is required and how that data is obtained or provided is critical to meeting the clients needs.  Some data maybe provided but other data is added while the application is in use.  Each requires a different approach and understanding.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

develop computer-based solutions to optimize, streamling or resolve and problem. A program is often developed as a need by either and indivudual or the many, these programs need time to develop and build to a working order while being usable.  my work on this project further improvess my process of application development through the use of design and implementation of new software and features.  Completing the needs of like Grazioso Salvare allowed the use of and improvement of my processes to design and task out goals creating a rapid workflow to build and release the software as it is being build and improved.
