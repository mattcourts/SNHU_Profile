Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

A grocery store is looking to analyze text records of daily sales focused on what items should be arranged on shelves to meet the demands of sales and increase sales of the items in question.  The data source is a text file configured to one word per line.  The program will analyze this text file and display the number of times each given items was in the text file.  The program has the ability to search for specific words and display all results in a histogram.

What did you do particularly well?

I spent extra focus on the python file using a library to scan the file creating a list containing the words and their occurance value.  This made structuring the data automatic for the accessor used by the C++ program to order the data displayed.  The file also focuses on template filters for simple input validation, while returning a not found in word search fail cases.  

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I would convert all the programming over to c++ to obscure the programming source code from easy access.  The code could be improved furhter improving variable handling and garbage collection.  Time could be spent on improving input validation and efficiency.  

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found the integration of Python code to be the toughest part, there is not a great amount of documentation on how to call each data type of a function.  This lead to step by step troubleshooting of the call function for calling the python source file.  

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills from this project were gained from learning Python integration, a useful skill for implementing test projects written in Python.  Other skills would be focused on the improvement of code focusing on error handling and improvement error response. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Internal commentation and organization of the code allows for the code to be improved upon in small sections at a time.  This will enable easier alteration to the code, allowing for a modular approach with changes made.
